Example HellaSwag json item:

{"ind": 24, "activity_label": "Roof shingle removal", "ctx_a": "A man is sitting on a roof.", "ctx_b": "he", "ctx": "A man is sitting on a roof. he", "split": "val", "split_type": "indomain", "label": 3, "endings": ["is using wrap to wrap a pair of skis.", "is ripping level tiles off.", "is holding a rubik's cube.", "starts pulling up roofing on a roof."], "source_id": "activitynet~v_-JhWjGDPHMY"}

ind: dataset ID
activity_label: The ActivityNet or WikiHow label for this example
context: There are two formats. The full context is in ctx. When the context ends in an (incomplete) noun phrase, like for ActivityNet, this incomplete noun phrase is in ctx_b, and the context up until then is in ctx_a. This can be useful for models such as BERT that need the last sentence to be complete. However, it's never required. If ctx_b is nonempty, then ctx is the same thing as ctx_a, followed by a space, then ctx_b.
endings: a list of 4 endings. The correct index is given by label (0,1,2, or 3)
split: train, val, or test.
split_type: indomain if the activity label is seen during training, else zeroshot
source_id: Which video or WikiHow article this example came from
